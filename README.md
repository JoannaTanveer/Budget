As an avid traveler, I want to be able to add expenses and deposits to my travel budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, I am able to populate/calculate the total when brought back online.
    With this app I am able to enter deposits, and expenses online and offline and when I am able to find connectivity the offline entries are added to the travel budget.
